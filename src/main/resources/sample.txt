There is at least one ‘good sign’ about the Getty fire.
Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said that while the Getty fire had burned 656 acres in West Los Angeles and was only
5 percent contained on Tuesday, “it’s a good sign, actually, that it didn’t grow by more.”

Mr. Garcetti thanked residents who had remained away from their homes in the evacuation area.
He said that firefighters had extinguished some flare-ups, and he warned that higher winds expected
in the evening could pick up embers from the fire and deposit them on houses in the evacuation area,
possibly igniting them while residents who did not evacuate were sleeping.

That danger was reiterated by Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas, who said that hot embers have been
known to carry for miles on the wind. “Our goal today is to increase containment as much as possible,
” he said, adding that he was “very concerned about tonight’s wind event.”

Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the fire, which broke out shortly after 1:30 a.m.
Monday along the major freeway known as the 405, near the Getty Center, the mayor said. It quickly
spread through neighborhoods north of Brentwood, destroying eight houses and damaging six more.
Some 7,000 homes are in the area considered to be under threat, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.
